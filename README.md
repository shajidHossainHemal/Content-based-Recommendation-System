# Content-based-Recommendation-Systems
Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. 

In this notebook, we will explore Content-based recommendation systems and implement a simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library.

A Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items to users based on their profile. The user's profile revolves around that user's preferences and tastes. It is shaped based on user ratings, including the number of times that user has clicked on different items or perhaps even liked those items. The recommendation process is based on the similarity between those items. Similarity or closeness of items is measured based on the similarity in the content of those items. When we say content, we're talking about things like the items category, tag, genre, and so on
